## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check build locally first
   npm run build
   npm run type-check
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Verify all variables are set in Vercel
   - Check for typos in variable names
   - Ensure Supabase keys are correct

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase URL is correct
   - Check RLS policies are configured
   - Test database connection locally

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify Supabase Auth is enabled
   - Check redirect URLs in Supabase settings
   - Test auth flow locally

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Review build and function logs

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables locally
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your values
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Supabase Logs**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Check the Logs section for errors
   - Verify RLS policies are working

## üîí Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive keys to Git
- Use Vercel's environment variable system
- Rotate keys regularly

### Database Security
- RLS policies are properly configured
- Admin access is restricted
- User roles are enforced

### Application Security
- HTTPS is enforced (Vercel default)
- Authentication is required for all routes
- Input validation is implemented

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- Vercel provides built-in analytics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Check for performance regressions

### Error Tracking
- Consider adding error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Monitor for 404s and 500s
- Track user experience issues

### Regular Maintenance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor Supabase usage
- Review and update security policies

## üöÄ Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Click "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain

2. **Configure DNS**
   - Follow Vercel's DNS instructions
   - Update your domain registrar

3. **SSL Certificate**
   - Vercel automatically provides SSL
   - No additional configuration needed

## üìû Support

For deployment issues:

1. **Check Vercel Documentation**: [vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
2. **Review Supabase Documentation**: [supabase.com/docs](https://supabase.com/docs)
3. **Contact Development Team**: For application-specific issues

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Once deployed, Vercel will automatically:
- Deploy on every Git push to main branch
- Create preview deployments for pull requests
- Maintain deployment history

**Best Practices:**
- Test changes locally before pushing
- Use feature branches for new development
- Review preview deployments before merging
